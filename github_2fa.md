4. Click **“Enable two-factor authentication”**
5. Choose **“Authentication App”**

## ✅ Step 2: Use an In-Browser Authenticator

> You may NOT use your phone in class, so use this extension instead:

🔗 [Authenticator Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai)

1. Click “Scan QR code” inside the extension
2. Point it at the GitHub QR code on your screen
3. Enter the 6-digit code it gives you into GitHub to complete setup

## 🛡️ Step 3: Save Your Recovery Codes

Once 2FA is set up, GitHub will show you a list of **8 recovery codes**. These codes are one-time-use and let you log in if 2FA fails.
