# üîê CC01 - GitHub 2FA Setup & Recovery Guide

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds extra security to your GitHub account. 

(Note: GitHub may be requiring this more and more.)

The most common form of 2FA is to include a phone number you have access to. But...

## I CANNOT HAVE MY PHONE OUT IN CLASS. 

---
## If GitHub asks you to enable 2FA, follow this guide carefully.

## Method 1: Save Your Recovery Codes

Once 2FA is set up, GitHub will show you a list of **8 recovery codes**. These codes are one-time-use and let you log in if 2FA fails.

### ‚úçÔ∏è WRITE THESE IN YOUR JOURNAL

Title the page:

GitHub Recovery Codes
(Student Name: __________________)


Then copy the codes one by one like this:

1) 9c1c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

2) 3b2f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

### üìá DO THE SAME ON THE INDEX CARD YOUR TEACHER GAVE YOU

### IF YOU NEED TO USE A CODE, YOU NEED TO CROSS IT OFF OF YOUR LIST.
### IF YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST 2 CODES LEFT, BE SURE TO GET MORE CODES.

## Method 2: Still set up your 2FA with your phone
