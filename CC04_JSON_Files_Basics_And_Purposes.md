# 🧱 JSON Files: The Basics and Their Purpose

## 📂 What is a JSON file?

**JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.  
It’s a simple, easy-to-read way to store and organize **data**.

A JSON file might look like this:

<pre> ```json { 
    "name": "Jordan", 
    "grade": 11, 
    "interests": ["basketball", "coding", "music"] 
  } ``` </pre>

⬆️ This file stores:
- A name (`"Jordan"`)
- A grade (`11`)
- A list of interests

## 🗝️ Key Terms in JSON

### 🔑 Key-Value Pair

A **key-value pair** is like a label and its content.

Example:

"name": "Jordan"

- "name" is the key
- "Jordan" is the value

Together, they make a pair where...
- Key = what kind of info
- Value = the actual info

A JSON "object" is simply a group of key-value pairs, grouped inside of curly braces { }.

## 🎯 Why do we use JSON?

**JSON is built for structure.**  
It’s perfect when you want to keep track of data in a consistent, readable format — like a digital filing cabinet.

You’ll see JSON files used for:
- ✅ **Saving user information**
- ✅ **Storing AI prompt/response pairs**
- ✅ **Submitting work in a way that’s easy for scripts to process**
- ✅ **Moving data between systems (e.g. AI models, web apps)**
